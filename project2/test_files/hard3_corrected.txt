"light the oven," she told gretel. "we're going to have a tasty roasted boy today!"
a little later, hungry and impatient, she went on: "run and see if the oven is hot enough."
gretel returned, whimpering: "i can't tell if it is hot enough or not." angrily, the witch screamed at the little girl:
"useless child! all right, i'll see for myself."
but when the witch bent down to peer inside the oven and check the heat, gretel gave her a tremendous push and slammed the oven door shut.
the

witch had come to a fit and proper end. gretel ran to set her brother free and they made quite sure that the oven door was
tightly shut behind the witch. indeed, just to be on the safe side, they fastened it firmly with a large padlock. then they

stayed for several days to  eat some more of the house,


   till they discovered amongst the witch's belongings, a huge chocolate egg. inside lay a casket of gold coins.
